## Class vs Object

* A class is a template for creating various objects.

* An object is an instance of a class with its own values.

```python

class User(id, name){
    this.id = id;
    this.name = name;
}

object = User(1,"John");

```

## Function vs Method

* A function is a piece of code that is called by name.

* A method is a piece of code that is called by a name that is associated with an object.

```python

function();

object.method();

```

## Parameter vs Argument

* A parameter is a variable in a function definition.

* An Argument is the data you pass into the parameter when a funtion is called.

```python

function squreRoot(parameter) {

// TODO 

}

squreRoot(argument);
```

## Statement vs Expression

* A statement is a complete line of code that performs some action.

* An expression is any section of code that evaluates to a value.

```python

print(2+2); // Statement

2+2 // Expression in the above statement

```
